# shoji

A vim theme that underlays code with colorful "paper rectangles".

## installation

If you donâ€™t have a preferred plugin helper, consider trying **vim-plug**, which can be installed with:

```
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

shoji can be installed using vim-plug by adding the following to the top of your vimrc...

```
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
Plug 'nightsense/shoji'
call plug#end()
```

...then restarting vim and running `PlugUpdate` (from the vim command line).

## activation

shoji consists of two themes:

- the exuberant `shoji_niji`, which underlays code with a rainbow of colorful paper rectangles
- the restrained `shoji_shiro`, which is content with a minimal practical set of paper rectangles

To activate, add `colorscheme shoji_niji` or `colorscheme shoji_shiro` to your vimrc.
