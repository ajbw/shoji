# shoji <img alt="a sort of logo for the shoji vim theme" src="https://github.com/nightsense/shoji/raw/master/images/shoji.png" height="58" />

A vim theme that conveys syntax with colorful highlighting (instead of colored text), as if each piece of code were underlayed with a paper rectangle.

Crafted with the magnificent [Colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate).

## variants

The shoji "theme" is actually a pair of themes.

**shoji_niji** is the exuberant one, papering the syntactic landscape in blocky rainbows.

**shoji_shiro** is the restrained one, content with pristine black-and-white, except where color is unavoidably practical.

## installation

If you donâ€™t have a preferred plugin helper, consider trying [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), which can be installed with:

```
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

With vim-plug, shoji can be installed by adding the following to the top of your vimrc...

```
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
Plug 'nightsense/shoji'
call plug#end()
```

...then restarting vim and running `PlugUpdate` (from the vim command line).

## activation

To activate a shoji theme, add one of the following to your vimrc:

- `colorscheme shoji_niji`
- `colorscheme shoji_shiro`

To easily toggle between the two shoji themes, add a keybinding to your vimrc, such as...

```
noremap <silent> <C-s> : if g:colors_name == "shoji_niji" <bar>
                       \ colorscheme shoji_shiro          <bar>
                       \ else                             <bar>
                       \ colorscheme shoji_niji           <bar>
                       \ endif                            <return>
```

...changing `<C-s>` (which denotes the keystroke [ctrl+s]) to suit your preference.
